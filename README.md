# Bookify

## What is this?
-Bookify is a book selling application.

Ever wondered where to get nice, cool and cheap books?
Look no further. We've got ya!

## App Development
Todos:
- Obtain a working till number (Applied)
- Implement deep linking (Still pending)
- Implement cloud storage and book sharing via link. Requires a lot of deep linking or downloads directly from server db
### Updates required by admin
- A comfortable reader
- Mpesa Payment. 
- Ability to comment. Similar to Wattpad. 
- Ability to share. Similar to Wattpad. 
- A blog. 
- Collect user data like email and mobile no. for future purposes. 
- A referral system. The aim is to make it attractive and beneficial for users to invite people to buy the book. I think a cash reward would be more effective than in-app credits. So something close to what network marketing schemes do. I'm thinking that if the book sells for 350 and a user invites another user successfully, they get 50.
